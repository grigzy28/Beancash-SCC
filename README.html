<p>Bean Cash is a digital currency re-branded from BitBean.</p>
<p><em>"Bean Cash is Bitcoin's Big Little Brother - Fast..Simple..Secure..More Than Digital Currency!"</em></p>

<h2>What Is Bean Cash?</h2>
<p>Bean Cash (Ticker: BITB) is a re-brand of BitBean. Bean Cash brings forward BitBean's legacy of lightening-fast transactions and a rock-solid network, with a mature blockchain--that is over 6 years old! 6 years is a long time in the "crypto-currency" space! In this time, Beancash has not hardforked or had a transaction roll-back. Bean Cash is developed by Bean Core, a virtual company comprised of individuals and entities around the world, with the purpose of moving development forward and helping to bring about consensus among the community. Bean Cash's mission: "To be an enduring digital currency, with high integrity, a store of value and a means of exchange of value in every day transactions -- that stands the test of time!"</p>
<p>Bean Cash is a digital currency and network based of of the original Bitcoin reference, with improvements that are ecological friendly (Proof of Bean Consensus), larger block sizes -- improving scalability, faster block targets --increasing speed, with overall lightening fast transactions! It features an innovative Proof of Bean (PoB) algorithm that more closely resembles traditional Proof of Work (PoW) crypto currencies, but without all the electricity demands and custom hardware as required to mine in traditional POW. Bean Cash is the first digital currency to implement a maximum of 20MB blocks, based off Gavin Andersen's proposals to fix Bitcoin's scalability limitations. Bean Cash is designed from the ground-up to be a transaction-centric and superior form of currency, for exchange of value in on-line purchases (idealy suited for micro-transactions) and purchases with traditional brick-and-mortar merchants. </p>
<p>In it's mission to be a transaction-centric digital currency with real world use, one of the goals for Bean Cash, is solving the "last mile issue" in the digital currency space. Specifically, the "last mile issue" deals with implimentation of infrastructure at the point of use. Instramental in this objective will be working with companies that are willing to implement Bean Cash at the Point of Sale/Service. Bean Cash is designed to support a network with over 1,300 TPS (Transactions Per Second), effecively being able to compete with companies such as PayPal. </p>
<p>As developers of Bean Cash, we are not looking to re-impliment a transaction system, based on the "Check/Cheque" model (et al. Bitcoin), where a merchant approves a transaction based on simple verification, and settlement happens much latter. That kind of model does not provide any more value than existing, charge back prone, credit cards. </p>
<p>Rather than use archaic models of the past, Bean Cash will allow merchants to verify, validate and settle transactions in near real time (a minute or less on average for a single confirmation transaction.) This is magnitudes faster than Bitcoin (10-30 times, or substantually more if transactions are back-logged), while providing no risk, with transactions being posted in near real time to the Bean Cash blockchain. This provides real value by allowing merchants to reduce risk, fraud, and costs as their percentage of Bean Cash transactions increases in their business. Fundamently, a zero confirmation transaction does not help to solve a real-world problem, as merchants still bear risk as with existing traditional payment methods (checks/cheques/Credit-Debit cards). </p>

our community members at:  <a href="https://live.beancash.org">https://live.beancash.org</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are a merchant with questions or interested in adopting Bean Cash in your
business, you may contact Bean Core <a href="mailto:support@beancash.org">via email</a>.</p>
<p>Later in 2021, we will be supporting a failover domain for our main website (https://www.beancash.org). The additional official domain will be: www.beancash.is Both beancash.org and beancash.is will be mirrored, offering redundancy for critical Bean Cash resources.</p>
<p>Bean Cash will be launching it's own DEX (Decentralized Exchange) in the near future. To foster access for the decentralized exchange, a portal will be established at:  https://www.beantrex.is Other Official portals will be established on the Maidsafe Network.
The DEX will launch after v2 of the Bean Cash Network is operational. v2 Bean Cash will be backwards compatible with nodes running v1.3.2 software and on the Official network/chain. Another hardfork is planned in 2021 with v1.5, after which only maintenance releases will be made available for v1.X branch. v2 Bean Cash is scheduled to go live in 2022.</p>
<h2>Bean Cash Specifications</h2>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>: Proof of Bean (PoB) &amp; Proof of Work (PoW distribution ended at block 10,000)
v2 of Bean Cash will introduce a Proof of Resources (PORes) model that will interoperate with PoB.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Work Algorithm</strong>: SHA-256</p>
<p><strong>PoW Block Reward</strong>: 100,000 BITB</p>
<p><strong>PoW Blocks</strong>: 10,000</p>
<p><strong>PoB Block Reward</strong>: 1000 BITB (1 BEAN)</p>
<p><strong>Target Blocktime</strong>: 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>RPC Port</strong>: 22461 (Testnet: 22463)</p>
<p><strong>Port</strong>: 22460 (Testnet: 22462)</p>
<p><strong>Time to Maturity</strong>: 110 Confirmations</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Time for Beans To Be Elgible to Sprout</strong>: 6 hours</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Supply for BITB (reached in or around 2023)</strong>: 5 Billion BITB</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Supply for BEAN</strong>: 21 Million BEAN</p>
<p>In 2023 Sprouting for BITB will be merged into BEAN, with a new Consensus Algorithm, Proof of Resource (PORes) that will combine with PoB (Proof of Bean).</p>
<p><strong>On August 2, 2021 @ 9:27:42PM GMT Bean Cash will start enforcing stricter Time Drift rules. Nodes not running v1.3.1 or later will be forked off the network and chain. These changes are necessary to move Bean Cash forward. Node operators must do more than just Sprout Beans, they must stay involved with the Community and keep their software updated on a timely basis! These changes are necessary to move Bean Cash forward. More significant updates will be coming and network node operators need to be agile and keep up! Bean Cash will once again become competitive in the Blockchain/Crypto Space, with our goal to get back into the top 100 of Crypto Currencies!</strong></p>
<h2>Bean Cash Monetary Units</h2>
<p>BEAN* = Whole Bean
BITB = Bit of a Bean
mBITB = milli-BITB
uBITB = micro-BITB
ADZUKI = Smallest Bean unit</p>
<p>*BEAN is reserved for Bean Cash v2.X(Project Aurora)
BITB is the base unit of Bean Cash v1.X</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BEAN</strong> = ÃŸ1 = 1,000(BITB)</li>
<li><strong>BITB</strong> = 1(BITB)</li>
<li><strong>mBITB</strong> = .001(BITB)</li>
<li><strong>uBITB</strong> = .000001(BITB)</li>
<li><strong>ADZUKI</strong> = .00000001(BITB)</li>
